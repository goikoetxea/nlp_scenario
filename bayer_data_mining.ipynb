       "  'Of particular relevance, intravitreal (IVT) administration of VEGF Trap has been shown to rapidly resolve existing vascular leak in the retinas of diabetic rodents, and in primates with active, laser-induced CNV.',\n",
       "  'The anti-inflammatory effect of VEGF Trap is likely attributable to its ability to bind VEGF-A and/or PlGF, which are known to mediate leukocyte chemotaxis via VEGFR-1 expressed on the surface of subpopulations of leukocytes, particularly macrophages and neutrophils.',\n",
       "  'VEGF Trap prevented the development of active CNV when given IVT at doses of 50, 250 or 500 \\xc2\\xb5g/eye every other week, as effectively as 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg given IV weekly.',\n",
       "  'Similarly, SC doses of VEGF Trap \\xe2\\x89\\xa510 mg/kg were required to achieve maximal elevations in blood pressure in telemetered rats.',\n",
       "  'VEGF Trap (single dose of 12.5 mg/kg IP) also suppressed CNV and reduced the inflammatory response in mice with induced corneal injury.Secondary pharmacodynamic studiesVEGF Trap at doses greater than 2.5 mg/kg (given s.c, twice weekly) administered to SCID mice bearing subcutaneously implanted mouse B16F1 melanoma, human A673 rhabdomyosarcoma, or mouse MMT mammary carcinoma, were sufficient to achieve maximally attainable VEGF Trap complex concentrations (1-2 \\xc2\\xb5g/ml).',\n",
       "  'Free VEGF Trap concentrations were \\xe2\\x89\\xa510 \\xc2\\xb5g/ml at these doses and this appeared to have a significant impact in inhibiting tumour growth in these animal models.VEGF Trap elevates blood pressure in both rats and mice in a manner that is dose dependent in both amplitude and duration of effect.',\n",
       "  'Blood pressure data taken after systemic single administration of VEGF-Trap from telemetered rodents were sensitive enough (rats>mice) to show a blood pressure increasing effect of VEGF Trap thereby revealing a good correlation with the well known blood pressure increasing mode of action of a VEGF inhibitor.',\n",
       "  'This was in contrast to the data obtained in toxicity studies with physically or chemically restrained Cynomolgus monkeys in which blood pressure was measured with an indirect method, the conventional oscillometric cuff system.',\n",
       "  'The lack of an effect of VEGF Trap on blood pressure is most probably due to the effects of chemical/physical restraint on the cardiovascular system of the Cynomolgus monkeys and the limited sensitivity of indirect blood pressure measurement systems as compared to direct, e.g.',\n",
       "  'CNS safety pharmacology has been reviewed from the repeat dose systemic toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously and intravenously with VEGF Trap.',\n",
       "  'There was no significant effect on venous and arterial thrombus formation following VEGF Trap treatment.In line with ICH S6(R1), respiratory effects have been examined as part of the toxicity studies.',\n",
       "  'Wound repair and healing in the rabbit incisional model was inhibited after repeat administration with VEGF-Trap at dose levels of 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg as demonstrated by a reduction in blood vessel density and tensile strength evaluation.',\n",
       "  'There was reduced fibrous response, neovascularisation and epidermal hyperplasia, resulting in larger wound areas following repeat administration with VEGF-Trap in the excisional wound healing model.',\n",
       "  'Following IVT administration to monkeys, VEGF Trap systemic absorption appears to be relatively high Tissue distribution following IV administration of [125I]-VEGF Trap to rats supported the assertion that distribution was limited primarily to the circulation.',\n",
       "  'Radioactivity was highest in the organs of clearance and other highly perfused tissues, predominately in the liver (11.4%), but also the kidney, spleen, lung and heart.',\n",
       "  'The decline seen in serum was also replicated in these organs: at 168 hours post-dosing, only 0.16% of the total radioactive dose was detected in the liver.',\n",
       "  'Vitreous humour contained the majority of VEGF Trap (compared to retina, choroid and plasma), suggesting accumulation in this compartment.',\n",
       "  'The vitreous and plasma concentrations of free VEGF Trap and the plasma concentrations of VEGF Trap complex were determined in 4 separate toxicology studies following single or repeated (either monthly or every 6 weeks) IVT dosing to male and female Cynomolgus monkeys.',\n",
       "  'Seven days following dosing the total concentration of bound VEGF Trap ranged from 100% (50 \\xc2\\xb5g/eye) to 26-34% (4000 \\xc2\\xb5g/eye).',\n",
       "  'The expected metabolism of VEGF Trap is expected to be to small peptides and amino acids and so further classical biotransformation studies are not required.Regarding the excretion, single 1 mg/kg IV doses were administered to functionally-nephrectomized and sham-operated female rats and serial VEGF.',\n",
       "  'Single dose toxicity studies were performed by IV administration (at doses of 50, 150 and 500 mg/kg) to rats.',\n",
       "  'The Minimum Lethal Dose and the Maximum Tolerated Dose were >500 mg/kg.Repeat dose toxicityThe sub-chronic and chronic toxicity of VEGF Trap was evaluated in the most relevant species, the Cynomolgus monkey, using the clinically relevant IVT route of administration.',\n",
       "  'Further systemic toxicity studies with VEGF Trap were undertaken in mice (SCID and CD-1), rats (Sprague Dawley and nude) and Cynomolgus monkeys by IV and SC routes.',\n",
       "  'There were no angiographic or electroretinographic changes following IVT treatment, however increased ocular pressure was seen in either VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap Placebo treated animals.',\n",
       "  'Administration of a lower volume (25 \\xce\\xbcl) of the VEGF Trap test article usually resulted in a much smaller immediate post-dose increase in IOP.',\n",
       "  'A LOAEL of 2 mg/eye is acceptable, and using this exposure ratios based upon the established LOAEL, Cmax and AUC determined from this toxicity study, was compared to the clinical exposure of VEGF Trap following IVT administration of 2 mg/eye.',\n",
       "  'PlGF1 and PlGF2 molecules in monkeys and humans only differ by 2 amino acids that are located outside of the known sites relevant for receptor binding and therefore this difference should not affect binding to VEGF Trap to an appreciable degree.Systemic: A comprehensive range of systemic toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and monkeys.',\n",

       "  'This is in line with previous CHMP scientific advice obtained by the applicant (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/310870/2007) and the requirements of ICH S6 (R1) guideline for preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals.',\n",
       "  'It is acceptable to not perform genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies.Reproduction Toxicity The effects of VEGF Trap on fertility were investigated in the context of the 6-month toxicity study in sexually mature Cynomolgus monkeys by IV administration.',\n",
       "  'Results showed decreased sperm motility and increased spermatozoa morphological abnormalities in males and abrogation of ovarian function and follicular development in females during treatment with VEGF Trap, along with abrogation of normal menstruation.',\n",
       "  'Following recovery, all VEGF Trap-treated females presented normal ovarian folliculogenesis and presence of medium to large size corpora lutea.',\n",

       "  'Animals treated at the high dose level (60 mg/kg) resulted in abortions and increased levels of skeletal malformations in F1 generation.',\n",
       "  'Exposure was 2907-fold (Cmax) and 678-fold (AUC0.5-72h) higher in the monkey study after 3 mg/kg dosing, compared to the anticipated human dose.Recommendation that VEGF Trap should not be used during pregnancy is appropriate from the findings of increased disruption to pregnancy and foetal malformations; this has been included in the SmPC in section 4.6.',\n",

       "  'Following extended intravitreal administration of VEGF Trap in clinical trials, positivity rates in the ADA assay were similar in patients regardless of treatment (VEGF Trap or ranibizumab).',\n",
       "  'It is therefore agreed that, based on the available data, there is no indication that IVT administration of VEGF Trap in patients would elicit a serious immune response.In some pregnant female rabbits, a total of five IV administrations resulted in the presence of anti-VEGF Trap antibodies associated with decreased levels of free VEGF Trap concentrations.',\n",
       "  'Discussion on non-clinical aspectsThe nonclinical studies were designed to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of VEGF Trap in support of clinical intravitreal (IVT) treatment of VEGF Trap.',\n",
